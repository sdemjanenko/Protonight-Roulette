#Protonight-Roulette

## Welcome
This project was inspired by the Febuary Protonight SF meetup.
Idea people were paired with developer people.
Instead of having to get people to pick up cards and then serially go through all the
numbers in the pairing process, I thought it would be awesome if there was a web app
that did just that.

Thus Protonight-Roulette was born.
